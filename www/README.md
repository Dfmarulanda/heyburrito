# Dashboard

The HeyBurrito dashboard is a simple GUI for the users and their burritos.
It ships with a default theme but you can easily create your own or download free
ones from the community.

## Creating a theme

The easiest way to get started is by copying the default theme and make the
changes you want.

The data comes from websocket connections managed with socket.io. Again, see example
in the default theme.

1. Copy default theme and name it how you like.
2. Theme the shit out of it!
3. Edit the `theme` option in the configuration.
